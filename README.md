# Suvidha-Foundation_ML-Internship
The project model is based on enhancing text summarization with a focus on rare and infrequently used words built with CNN/DailyMail Dataset using Python Libraries and Machine Learning Algorithms


# TOPIC NAME - Text Summarization With Rare Words
In an era of explosive internet content, automatic text summarization has emerged as a vital solution. There is a challenge for taking care of rare and infrequently used words in text summarization. There are various aspects of extractive, abstractive, and hybrid approaches, harnessing transformer models and attention mechanisms to reshape text summarization. The results were compared using the well-known ROUGE metric.


## DATASET FOR EVALUATION
The CNN / DailyMail Dataset is a collection of English-language news articles, encompassing more than 300,000 unique journalistic pieces from CNN and the Daily Mail. Originally designed for machine reading, comprehension, and abstractive question answering, the dataset now caters to both extractive and abstractive summarization tasks.

The articles and highlights features are used as a 'source_text' and 'target_summary' respectively as a training data. The target_summary feature is used to test the model generated summarization vs the author generated summarization of the source_text.

## FINAL RESULTS
The ROGUE scores are used to calculate the performance of the model.
